please post to the mailing-list instead: http://groups.google.com/group/esprima.
Do not forget to explore the extensive documentation: http://esprima.org/doc/.

Please report one problem at a time! Refrain from filing a bulk report at once since
it will make it difficult to follow-up and we may have to close the issue.
